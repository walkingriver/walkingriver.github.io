Angular is on a six-month release cadence, which means you need to stay on top of them in your own projects. The last thing you want to do is wake up one day and find that the latest version was just released and you are stuck on a version from two and a half years ago. Fortunately, the Angular team has made it very easy to upgrade.

# Official Upgrade Guidance
Did you know that Angular offers official upgrade guidance? If you have not seen the website, take a look here at the [Angular Upgrade Guide](https://update.angular.io){:target="_blank"}.

# My Project
The project I am upgrading is the demo application presented in my book and course on Ionic and Angular development. You can find [both at Gumroad](https://walkingriver.gumroad.com){:target="_blank"}.

The application itself is an Ionic app, written to run equally well on both desktop and mobile devices. 

At the time I began, it was an Angular 8 app that had been automatically generated by the Ionic CLI. 

You can see the app as it was just before I started the upgrade at its [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/walkingriver/at10dance-angular/tree/chapter2-demo){:target="_blank"}.

I do not want it to fall too far behind, so I decided I should upgrade it to Angular 10 and make sure it works.

# Angular 8.x to 8.y
The first thing I did was make sure the project was on the latest version of Angular 8. I did this by first making sure I had a clean repo (I did) and then entering the following command (and its output):

```bash
npx ng update @angular/cli@8 @angular/core@8

The installed Angular CLI version is older than the latest stable version.
Installing a temporary version to perform the update.
Installing packages for tooling via npm.
Installed packages for tooling via npm.
Using package manager: 'npm'
Collecting installed dependencies...
Found 35 dependencies.
Fetching dependency metadata from registry...
Package '@angular/core' is already up to date.
    Updating package.json with dependency @angular-devkit/build-angular @ "0.803.29" (was "0.803.25")...
    Updating package.json with dependency @angular/cli @ "8.3.29" (was "8.3.25")...
UPDATE package.json (1619 bytes)
✔ Packages installed successfully.
```

I specifically asked the CLI to update to @angular/cli and @angular/core version 8, which will update to the most recent minor/revision available to that major version.

I used `npx` to use the local Angular CLI version in the project. As you can see from the warning that it had its own idea and installed a temporary version to perform the update.

Apparently I was pretty close to current on Angular 8. It did not do much.

Next, I committed the code. Angular will not update on an unclean working repo.

```bash
git commit -am "Updated to latest Angular 8"
[master e9e9c71] Updated to latest Angular 8
 2 files changed, 3429 insertions(+), 2214 deletions(-)
 ```

You can compare what changed by [reviewing the diff on GitHub](https://github.com/walkingriver/at10dance-angular/commit/e9e9c712a5f68933b690a70c55816ec75145dcc1){:target="_blank"}. Again, not much happened.

# Angular 8 to Angular 9
Next, I upgraded the project to Angular 9, with this command (it should look familiar).

```bash
npx ng update @angular/cli@9 @angular/core@9
```

This command did a lot more than the last one because now we are looking at an update of a major version.

Here is the output: 

```bash

  Migration completed.

❯ ModuleWithProviders migration.
  In Angular 9, the ModuleWithProviders type without a generic has been deprecated.

Your project has been updated to Angular version 9!
For more info, please see: https://v9.angular.io/guide/updating-to-version-9
```

There were some warnings, which I will take care of eventually. For now, they did not affect the application. I then committed the changes. 

```bash
git commit -am"Upgraded to Angular 9"
[master ba20fd7] Upgraded to Angular 9
 3 files changed, 3695 insertions(+), 2830 deletions(-)
 ```
The [GitHub diff is here](https://github.com/walkingriver/at10dance-angular/commit/ba20fd715c5e8373699e0c5d37aa638fe0f456b0){:target="_blank"}.

The only thing of note that it changed was that it added this bit of JSON to the angular.json file: 

```json
{
  "type": "anyComponentStyle",
  "maximumWarning": "6kb"
}
```

# Angular 9 to Angular 10
Finally, I let the CLI upgrade from Angular 9 to Angular 10.

```bash
npx ng update @angular/cli @angular/core

```

As before, I committed the code and checked the behavior of the application.

```bash
git commit -am"Upgraded to Angular 10"
[master a0114c1] Upgraded to Angular 10
 2 files changed, 1945 insertions(+), 897 deletions(-)
```

The [GitHub diff is here](https://github.com/walkingriver/at10dance-angular/commit/a0114c149e637a90394b35a8888f83fac38728c8){:target="_blank"}. As you can see, it only updated packages. Though it showed many of the same warnings, it did not find anything in the code it needed to migrate.

As I reviewed those migration guides, I also did not find any issues to update. I cannot confirm this, but I believe that the Ionic team keeps on top of these things and uses the latest Angular guidance in their application generators.

# Summary
Will your upgrade go as smoothly? I cannot guarantee it, of course. Honestly, the application is modest enough that I did not expect any problems. 

As a convenient summary, here the commands I used (without the command output being shown).

```bash
npx ng update @angular/cli@8 @angular/core@8
git commit -am "Updated to latest Angular 8"
npx ng update @angular/cli@9 @angular/core@9
npx ng generate component Loading --spec=false --dry-run\n
git commit -am"Upgraded to Angular 9"
npx ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
git commit -am"Upgraded to Angular 10"
```

As I said, your experience may not be the same as mine. You may not even need `npx`. I hope this article helped you, even a little, and I wish you every success in your own endeavors.
